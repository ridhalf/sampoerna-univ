          At the upper division (years 3 and 4), Sampoerna University offers
          the opportunity to earn two degrees through its partnership with the
          University of Arizona. This collaboration allows students to
          complete both an Indonesian Sarjana 1 and a bachelor's degree from
          the University of Arizona without ever leaving Indonesia. The
          University of Arizona, a leading research institution in the U.S.,
          is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission, as well as the
          American Association of Colleges and Schools of Business (AACSB).
          Graduates of the two-degree programs available in Business and
          Engineering receive diplomas and transcripts from both institutions.
          In addition to that, Sampoerna University is legally acknowledged by
          the Ministry of Education and Culture of the Republic of Indonesia.
