        support teaching and learning activities. In fact, campus facilities
        are one of the considerations for prospective students before

        The more complete the campus facilities, the higher the quality of
        the teaching-learning process that is carried out. The completeness
        of a campus' facilities is one indicator of the assessment carried
        out by the authorities. Given the importance of complete facilities,
        campuses are competing to make it happen. In addition, complete
        facilities are also an advantage to attract new students.
