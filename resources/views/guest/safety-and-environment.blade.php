              Campus security officers are present on every floor of SU.
              They report to Administrative Services and have
              responsibilities on all parts of the campus. The major
              responsibility of campus security officers is to give
              attention to every situation which might involve the safety
              and welfare of faculty, staff, students and visitors. When
              there are infractions of local or national laws and/or college
              regulations, the campus security officers are authorized to
              take appropriate action. For more serious incidents that pose
              a direct threat to lives and property, local police will be
              notified to respond. In addition, campus security officers
              will refer faculty, staff and students to Administrative
              Services for internal action.

              immediately. GA will notify security to secure the situation
              and notify local police. If there is a direct exit away from
              the event, use it. Do not enter hallways and do not pull the

              During orientation each semester, all faculty, staff and

              emergency exits and manual alarm systems across campus and how
              to use them. Specific training is provided to Safety Captains
              who are on duty on each floor. Safety Captains receive
              specific training regarding the use of fire extinguishers
              and/or hoses, assessing a fire hazard, and notifying emergency

              The main building has an active fire control detection and

              and/or increased room temperatures) automatically activates
              the fire alarm. In addition, there are manual station alarms
              located throughout the campus that can be activated by
              breaking glass and pulling the alarm

            <p class="decs">
              If a minor fire appears controllable, Administrative Services
              should be immediately notified. The individual or local Safety
              Captain should then promptly direct the charge of the fire
              extinguisher or water from the fire hose toward the base of
              the flame

              If the fire appears uncontrollable and poses a threat to

              notified to request that the building evacuation alarm be
              sounded (if the automatic system has not previously sounded). 
              All rooms should then be evacuated, closing all doors to
              confine the fire and reduce oxygen.  Doors must not be locked
              upon exit.

            <p class="decs">
              Once the building evacuation alarm is sounded, the nearest
              Safety Captain will be mobilized to assist with the evacuation
              of their area by directing people to safety exits. Additional
              help will be provided to any handicapped individuals that
              require assistance. If a smoke event exists, the Safety
              Captain will remind everyone to stay as close to the floor as
              possible during evacuation. Evacuees will muster at three
              designated safety muster points located in outside areas clear
              of hazards.

                If you become trapped in a building during a fire and a
                window is available, place an article of clothing (shirt,
                coat, etc.) outside the window as a signal for the rescue
                crews. If there is no window, stay near the floor where the
                air will be less toxic. Shout at regular intervals to alert
                emergency crews. Do not panic.
