                      What is GED? <br />
                      You may hear other meanings for GED such as Graduate
                      Equivalency Degree or General Educational Diploma.
                      However, GED traditionally stands for General
                      Educational Development Test.
                    </p>
                    <p class="decs">
                      After graduating from high school, you will receive a
                      diploma. A diploma is a document stating you've
                      completed all the required courses to graduate. Some
                      students in high school are close to finishing and
                      getting a diploma, but don't quite get there. In those
                      cases, students can take a series of tests that will
                      indicate whether they have a high school level of
                      education. This is known as the GED test.

                      <p class="decs">
                        The GED test has four main areas of testing:

                      You will take four separate tests that together make up
                      the entire GED exam. Each test takes at least one hour,
                      and you must get a certain score to pass. You can
                      schedule one test at a time or all four at once.
